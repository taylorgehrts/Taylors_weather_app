-As a user I want a simple weather app that allows me to look up a city and display the weather for today and the following 5 days

-This was built from the ground up and no starter code was used.

-The basic structure was made in HTML with some assistance from bootstrap for styling and layout.

-The app is based on the open weather api, using the 5 day forcast 3 hour api call.  I also use their geocoding api to convert city names into cooridinates.

-When you search for a city the name of the city will print to the screen below the search bar and allow the user to click these results to see the weather conditions from previous searches

-List of technologies used: HTML, Bootstrap css framework, CSS, Jquery, Javascript, open weather api with help from the built in fetch methods.
